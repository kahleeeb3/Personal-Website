- Single-Page Application (SPA)

# Plugins
1. Prism.js

```
python3 -m http.server
```

# To Do:
- Add subpage for larger projects.
- Need to be able to link thread posts to subsections of larger pages.
- Add version to scripts so the scripts are forced to reload every time.
- Probably need to make the sidebar scrollable for subpage navigation.
- when clicking home on mobile, it should close the sidebar by default.
- clicking images opens a larger view
- need to account for clicking internal links that don't exist.
