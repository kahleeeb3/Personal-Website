<h1>A Simple File System</h1>
<p>
    The goal of this project is to design and implement a simple file system called cpmFS
    (i.e., CP/M file system). Through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, CP/M (Control
    Program for Microcomputers) - a disk-based operating system - had dominated its era
    as much as MS-DOS and later Windows dominated the IBM PC world. CP/M is clearly
    not the last word in advanced file systems, but it is simple, fast, and can be
    implemented by a competent programmer in less than a week.
</p>
<p>
    Our simple file system will allow users to <b>list directory entries, rename files, copy files,
    delete files, as well as read/write/open/close files.</b> We will use a version of
    the CP/M file system used on 5.25” and 8” floppy disks in the 1970's (support for CP/M
    file systems is still included in Linux to this day). We will develop our code in C. This
    can be done on any computer with an ANSI C compiler (e,g. gcc, clang, etc.). We will not be
    modifying the linux kernel but developing a stand-alone program (i.e., a simulated filesystem).
</p>
<p>
    Before we discuss the functionalities of the file system we need to explain how data is stored on
    our file system.
</p>

<!-- DATA FORMAT -->
<div id="collapsible" data-title="Data Format" class="expanded">
    <h2>Extent</h2>
    <p>
        Every file within our file system will have an associated <b>extent</b>. The extent (also called the <b>File
            Control Block</b> or Directory Entry) is a
        struct that contains exactly 32 bytes. These 32 bytes are split into two 16-byte sections. The first 16-byte
        section contains basic information about the file.
        The first byte of this section contains the file <b>status</b>. To delete a file, we simply mark its status as
        invalid. The next 8 bytes contain the file <b>name</b>.
        The next 3 bytes are reserved for the file <b>extension</b> name. The final 4 bytes are reserved for
        <b>XL,BC,XH, and RC</b>. We will cover these later but for now we will say
        that XL, and XH are reserved/unused for if we want to change the file system structure in the future. For now,
        we will not be using those two bytes.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <img src="/pages/operating systems/files/extent.png" id="figure" style="width: 50%;" />
    </div>
    <p>
        The last 16-byte section contains <b>block pointers</b> (also referred to as block addresses). Each block
        pointer is a 8 bits (1 byte) that points to a single <b>block address space</b>. Because the second
        section contains 16-bytes, and each pointer is a single byte, <b>each file can contain up to 16 blocks</b>. Each
        block contains 1024 bytes (1kB).
        Our FS can support in total 2^8= <b>256 blocks</b>. Thus, the address stored by our block pointer can be
        anywhere from 0-255. <b>Block 0 contains all extents in our FS</b>. We refer to this block as a <b>Super
            Block</b>. Because this block (like all others) is 1024
        bytes in size, it can hold a maximum of
    </p>
    <latex-code>1024 \text{ Bytes}/ \frac{32 \text{ Bytes}}{\text{ extent}} = 32 \text{ extents}</latex-code>
    <p>
        This means <b>our FS can contain up to 32 files</b>. However, If we assume each file uses exactly 16 bytes, we
        can have up to
    </p>

    <latex-code>256 \text{ Blocks}/\frac{32 \text{ Bytes}}{\text{extent}} = 16 \text{ Files}</latex-code>

    <h2>Disk</h2>
    <p>
        Our simulated hard disk will be stored in a file named <b>image1.img</b>. This disk will contain 256 blocks as
        previously stated. Block 0 will be reserved for the file system itself.
        It will contain the extents for every file as previously stated. Each block contains 1-8 <b>sectors</b>. Each
        sector can have up to 128 bytes. Every block other than the last block is
        <b>“fully loaded”</b>. The last block is <b>“partial filled”</b> meaning some sectors are not filled. We say the
        number of filled sectors is the <b>RC</b> value. The amount of space used
        in the partially filled sector in the last block is the <b>BC</b> value.
    </p>

    <div align="center">
        <img src="/pages/operating systems/files/disk.png" id="figure" style="width: 50%;" />
    </div>

    <h2>File Size</h2>

    <p>To calculate the file size, we will use the following equation</p>
    <latex-code>fileSize = NB \cdot 1024 \text{ Bytes} + RC \cdot 128 \text{ Bytes} + BC</latex-code>
    <p>
        Where <i>NB</i> is the number of fully loaded blocks, <i>RC</i> is the number of sectors in last block, and
        <i>BC</i> is the number of bytes in the last
        sector. To get <i>NB</i> we will iterate over the blocks in the file <i>extent</i> until we find a null pointer
        indicating that block is not assigned. <i>RC</i>
        and <i>BC</i> are given in the 4-byte section after the file extension.
    </p>

<!-- STARTING POINT -->
<div id="collapsible" data-title="Data Access" class="expanded">
    <!-- <p>
        We will begin our coding process with the following <a
            href="https://github.com/kahleeeb3/cpmFS/releases/tag/v1.0.0">provided source code</a>.
        In this provided code is a file named <b>diskSimulator.c</b>. This file contains the <b>readImage()</b> and
        <b>blockRead()</b> functions as well as a global variable named <b>disk</b>. The disk variable is a globally 
        allocated memory space which stores the bytes contained within the disk.
    </p> -->
    <p>
        To access the data from "image1.img" in our code, we will define a global variable named <b>disk</b>. This variable will store all
        bytes contained within our disk image in the following format:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        static uint8_t disk[256][1024];
    </script>
    <p>
        The disk contains space for the <b>256 blocks</b> in "image1.img" that each have <b>1024 bytes</b> for the 8 different 128 byte sectors that every block contains.  
    </p>

    <!-- READING DISKS -->
    <h2>Reading Disks</h2>
   
    <p>
        Initially the disk variable contains no data. We need to use a function named <b>readImage()</b> to store the data from "image1.img" in the disk
        variable. This function takes the file name as a variable. The readImage() function is shown below:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        size_t readImage(char *fileName) { 
            FILE *fp; 
            size_t bytesRead = -1; 
            fp = fopen(fileName,"r"); 
            // C uses row major order for multi dim arrays
            bytesRead = fread(disk,BLOCK_SIZE,NUM_BLOCKS,fp); 
            fclose(fp); 
            return bytesRead;
        }
    </script>
    <p>
        After calling this function, <u><b>all data from the image1.img file is stored into a global variable named disk</b></u>.
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        readImage("image1.img");
    </script>

    <!-- READING BLOCKS -->
    <h2>Reading Blocks</h2>
    <p>
        Now that we have the disk stored into a global variable, we would like to access the extents stored on the disk.
        <b>Extents are stored in block 0 of the disk</b>. To access the data of a single block, we will use a function called
        <b>blockRead()</b>. This function is shown below:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        int blockRead(uint8_t *buffer,uint8_t blockNum) { 
            int i = 0; 
            for (i=0; i<1024;i++) { 
                *(buffer+i) = disk[(int) blockNum][(int) i];
            } 
            return 0; 
        } 
    </script>

    <p>
        blockRead() takes a pointer to a buffer (where the block data will be stored) and a blockNum value, and reads the contents of the specified block
        from the disk array into the specified buffer. Since we would like to read block 0 into a pointer named <b>e</b>, we can do the following:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        uint8_t *e = (uint8_t *)malloc(BLOCK_SIZE); // define where block 0 data is stored
        blockRead(e, 0); // read data from block 0 into "block0"
    </script>
    <p>
        Now that we have called the blockRead() function <u><b>a pointer to all extent data in block0 of the global disk variable is stored into a local pointer variable named e</b></u>.
        This is an extremely important point. Please ensure you fully understand this concept before moving forward.
    </p>
    
    <!-- READING EXTENTS -->
    <h2>Reading Extents</h2>
    <p>
        To get information on the files stored in the disk, we will need to read the extents stored in block 0. in the previous section
        we defined a pointer to this location in memory named "e". We will read extent information from "e" into a <b>dirStructType</b> data structure
        that we will define below:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        typedef struct dirStruct {
            uint8_t status; // 0xe5 = unused, 0-16 = user number
            char  name[9]; // no need to support attributes in msb  of bytes 0,1,2,7
            char  extension[4]; // no need to support attributes in msb  of bytes 0,1,2
            uint8_t XL; // see below for these 4  bytes' meaning
            uint8_t BC;
            uint8_t XH;
            uint8_t RC;
            uint8_t blocks[BLOCKS_PER_EXTENT]; // array of disk sectors used
        } DirStructType;
    </script>
    <p>
        To fully understand the variables in this struct please <b>review the Data Format section</b>. The values of this dirStructType will be populated
        by a function named <b>mkDirStruct()</b>. I have provided a prototype of this function below:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        //function to allocate memory for a DirStructType (see above), and populate it, given a
        //pointer to a buffer of memory holding the contents of disk block 0 (e), and an integer index
        // which tells which extent from block zero (extent numbers start with 0) to use to make the
        // DirStructType value to return.
        DirStructType *mkDirStruct(int index,uint8_t *e);
    </script>

    <!-- SUMMARY -->
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Our data will be stored in an file named "image1.img" and read into a 1024x256 array using the readImage() function.
        We can extract block 0 (named e) using the blockRead() function. We can extract a single extent (named d) using the mkDirStruct() function.
        Extent data will be stored in a DirStruct that contains file information for every file stored in our file system.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <img src="/pages/operating systems/files/extent_access.png" id="figure" style="width: 40%;" />
    </div>
    <p>
        For example, the following code can be used to <b>access extent 2 from image1.img</b> and print the name of the file there:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        static uint8_t disk[256][1024]; // define where disk data is stored
        readImage("image1.img"); // read data from "image1.img" into "disk"
        uint8_t *e = (uint8_t *)malloc(BLOCK_SIZE); // define where block 0 data is stored
        blockRead(e, 0); // read data from block 0 into "e"
        DirStructType *d = (DirStructType *)malloc(sizeof(DirStructType)); // allocate mem for a DirStructType
        DirStructType* d = mkDirStruct(2,e);
        printf("%s\n",d->name); // print fileName
        free(e); // free malloc space
        free(d); // free malloc space
    </script>

</div>


<!-- LISTING FILES -->
<div id="collapsible" data-title="Listing Files" class="expanded">
    <p>
        We would like to print the file directory to stdout. Each filename should be printed on its own line,
        with the file size, in base 10, following the name and extension, with one space between
        the extension and the size. An example of this output follows bellow.
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
        DIRECTORY LISTING
        mytestf1.txt 15874
        holefile.txt 1152
        shortf.ps 1032
        mytestf. 1026
    </script>
    <p>
        To achieve this result we will write a function named <a href="https://github.com/kahleeeb3/cpmFS/blob/main/src/cpmfsys.c#L151" target="_blank">cpmDir()</a>. The pseudo code for this function is shown below:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        void cpmDir(){
            printf("DIRECTORY LISTING\n");
            blockRead(); // load block 0
            for(extent in block0){
                d = mkDirStruct(); // get extent data
                if(extent is valid){
                    for(blocks in extent){
                        if(block is valid){
                            NB++; // increase the num bytes used by last sector
                        }
                    }
                    NB--; // account for partially filled sector
                    file_size = (NB * 1024) + (d->RC * 128) + d->BC; // calc file size
                    printf("%s.%s %d\n", d->name, d->extension, file_size); // print file name and size
                }
            }
        }
    </script>
    <p>
        We begin by reading the reading block0 into a pointer named <b>e</b> using the <a href="https://github.com/kahleeeb3/cpmFS/blob/main/src/diskSimulator.c#L7" target="_blank">blockRead()</a>
        function. This function takes the data stored in the "disk" variable at a specific index and stores it into a buffer that we pass. In this case the index is 0.
        Creation of the DirStruct is done using the <a href="https://github.com/kahleeeb3/cpmFS/blob/main/src/cpmfsys.c#L7" target="_blank">mkDirStruct()</a> function.
        This function allocates memory for a DirStructType (see above), and populate it, given a pointer to a buffer of memory holding the contents of disk block 0 (e), and an integer index
        which tells which extent from block zero (extent numbers start with 0) to use to make the DirStructType value to return. We will discuss the implementation of this function in a later
        section. For now just know that it populates the DirStructType we discussed earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> we define the extent to be invalid if the extent status is equal to 0xe5. We define the block to be invalid if the block hold as value of zero.
        Note that we will label block zero as "e" and each extent as "d" as discussed previously. Memory for both of these need to be allocated using <i>malloc()</i>
        and freed using <i>free()</i>. An example of this is provided below but to keep the pseudo code short, we will not be mentioning this in future sections.
    </p>

</div>

<!-- SHOWING FREE BLOCKS -->
<div id="collapsible" data-title="Showing Free Blocks" class="expanded">  
    <p>
        It may be desirable to print out a list of all the blocks contained within our disk. To do this we will create a data structure named <b>freeList</b>.
        FreeList is a global <b>bit vector</b> which contains a bit value of <b>true</b> if the block is free or <b>false</b> if the block is not free.
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        bool freeList[NUM_BLOCKS];
    </script>
    <p>
        We will need to populate the freeList using a function called <b>makeFreeList()</b>. This function iterates over the block contained within
        each extent and checking if it contains any valid data (does not have a value of 0). pseudo code for this function is provided below:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        // set all blocks to be free initially
        void makeFreeList(){
            freeList[0] = false; // block 0 is always in use
            blockRead(); // load block 0

            for(extent in block0){
                d = mkDirStruct(); // get extent data
                if(extent is valid){
                    for(blocks in extent){
                        if(block is valid){
                            freeList[this block index] = false; // mark as used
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    </script>
    <p>
        The structure of makeFreeList() is very similar to cpmDir() since we iterate over each block in each extent. To print the free list we will use a function
        <b>printFreeList()</b>. This function will print out the contents of the free list in 16 rows of 16, with each row prefixed by the 2-digit hex address of 
        the first block in that row. Denote a free-block with a ".", and a used block with a "*". Here is an example of the output:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
        FREE BLOCK LIST: (* means in-use)
        00: * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . 
        10: * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
        20: * . . . * . . . . . . . . . . . 
        30: * * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
        40: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
        50: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
        60: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
        70: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
        80: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
        90: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

        f0: . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . *
    </script>
    <p>
        printFreeList() simply iterates over freeList to decide what to print so I will not include pseudo code for that function.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- SHOWING FREE BLOCKS -->
<div id="collapsible" data-title="Delete and Rename Files" class="expanded">
    <p>
        Deleting and renaming files are very similar in functionality. These two are done with the <b>cpmDelete()</b> and <b>cpmRename()</b> functions respectively.
        First the functions will allocate space for the "e" pointer as shown previously, and then use a function <b>findExtentWithName()</b> to locate a specific extent
        by the name of the file contained within that extent and returning the index of the extent.
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        int findExtentWithName(char *name, uint8_t *block0);
    </script>
    <p>
        The findExtentWithName() function calls anotther function called <b>splitFileName()</b> which takes a file name string and a buffer to two pointers: name and extension. The function then parses
        the filename into a name and extension and returns.
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        int splitFileName(char *filename, char *name, char *extension);
    </script>
    <p>
        This allows the extents to be located if the name and extension match that of the selected extent. For example consider these lines from the findExtentWithName() function:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        d = mkDirStruct(extent_index, block0); // get the extent data and store it
        if (d->status != 0xe5){
            // check that the files match
            int name_match = strcmp(search_name, d->name);
            int ext_match = strcmp(search_ext, d->extension);
            if (name_match == 0 && ext_match == 0)
            {
                return extent_index;
            }
        }
        free(d); // free data used by malloc
    </script>
    <p>
        Now that the extent has been located by name, the functionalities of cpmDelete() and cpmRename() differ. cpmDelete() will need to iterate over the blocks in the
        extent and label them as free in the freeList. It will also need to change the status of the dir struct to be invalid (essentially marking it as deleted). cpmRename()
        needs to check that the name string is a valid file name. It will do this using a function called <b>checkLegalName()</b>. This function ensures that the file name length
        and extension length will fit into the buffer and do not contain any invalid characters. Once the file name is confirmed to be valid, cpmRename() will change the 
        dirStruct to have the new file name and extension.
    </p>
    <p>
        After these changes to the dirStructType are made, we need to finalize them. We do this using the <b>writeDirStruct()</b> function. This function will read the bytes
        from the dirStructType and either writing the bytes to the "disk" global variable using the <b>blockWrite()</b> function OR write them to the "image1.img" file using
        the <b>writeImage()</b> function. Since we want these steps to be reproducible, we will use the <b>blockWrite()</b>. However, for a real FS it would be better to use 
        <b>writeImage()</b>. Bellow is the code for blockWrite():
    </p>

        In conclusion, we will test the functionality of our File System using the following main function:
    </p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
        int main(int argc, char * argv[]) { 
            readImage("image1.img"); 
            makeFreeList(); 
            cpmDir(); 
            printFreeList(); 
            cpmDelete("shortf.ps");
            cpmDir();
            cpmRename("mytestf1.txt","mytest2.tx");
            fprintf(stdout,"cpmRename return code = %d,\n",cpmRename("mytestf","mytestv2.x"));
            cpmDir(); 
            printFreeList();
            return 0;
          }
    </script>
    <p>
        The output of this function is shown below:

    <p>
        As we can see, the file system successfully reads the "image1.img", lists all the files contained within this disk, prints
        the block usage in a 16x16 list, renames "mytestf1.txt" to "mytest2.tx", renames "mytestf" to "mytestv2.x", and then once again
        prints the list of files and the freeList. For <b>future work</b>, we should allow the user to 
        copy files, delete files, as well as read/write/open/close files. Additionally, changes should be written to the disk itself and
        a user interface should be designed.
