<h1>Memory Overview</h1>

<p>
    On the GBA, specific areas of memory are mapped directly to hardware functions. To get the GBA to do anything, you
    need to write data to specific sections of memory. This is known as <b>memory-mapped IO</b>. Luckily the
    hardware
    is well documented in the <a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">Tonc Text</a> and the <a
        href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~tjh8300/CowBite/CowBiteSpec.htm">CowBite Spec</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Disclaimer:</b> Hardware
    documentation for this blog post are mostly summarized from theses sources. You really should read those for a full
    understanding. However, I know you're here because you don't want to do that. So, I will summarize the content you
    need to know for rest of this blog post. This is where the fun begins...
</p>

<p>
    Below is a table of the important sections of memory. We will mostly be focused on the ones highlighted since they
    control video output. I'm placing this in a separate section since you will likely need to reference it often.

                Due to the 16bit port, you want this section's code to be THUMB

                and the fact that it's embedded in the CPU make this the fastest

                be loaded at once, so put your ARM code here.
