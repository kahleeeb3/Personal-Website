<h1>Game Boy Development</h1>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to develop programs for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance using the C programming language.
  The Game Boy Advance (GBA) comes in several different variations with similar hardware. Being released in 2003, the
  Game Boy Advance SP was my first childhood handheld console. The GBA also has the benefit of being a very well
  documented console so research on its hardware and development libraries such as "Tonc" are very accessible to the
  average person.

    We will begin our development by first explaining how the development environment is setup. Because useful tools
    such as "make" are not conveniently available in Windows, we will be using a linux distribution for our development.
    I have chosen to use <b>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</b>. WSL is a feature of Windows that allows developers to
    run a Linux environment without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting. Additionally, we will need
    a compiler that can turn C code into a GBA binary. For this I have chosen to use <b>devkitPro</b>, which is based on
    the GNU compiler collection (GCC). We will also need a program capable of running our compiled binaries for testing
    purposes. There are many options available for this, but I have chosen to go with <b>mGBA</b>. If you would like to
    run your compiled code on actual hardware, I suggest purchasing a <a href="https://a.co/d/22hul8W">EZ-FLASH
      OMEGA</a> from a source such as Amazon. Additionally, a useful programming library that you can use is <b>Tonc
      v1.4.2</b>. This library comes with very useful documentation that can be found <a
      href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will begin our setup by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">installing WSL</a>. This
    is a very simple process and only requires you to open Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode and enter the
    following command:
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
      wsl --install
    </script>

  <p>
    The distro will default to Ubuntu. Now that WSL is installed we can launch it using this command:
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
      wsl
    </script>

  <p>
    We now need to setup a workspace directory. I created the following folder in WSL:
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
      cd ~; mkdir Desktop; cd Desktop
    </script>

  <p>
    To make things simple you may clone the entire repo to this directory:
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
      git clone https://github.com/kahleeeb3/Gameboy.git
    </script>

  <p>
    Now we will need to install devkitPro as mentioned earlier.
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
      wget https://apt.devkitpro.org/install-devkitpro-pacman
      chmod +x ./install-devkitpro-pacman
      sudo ./install-devkitpro-pacman
    </script>

  <p>
    You may need to make a symlink for /etc/mtab. See <a
      href="https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/150">https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/150</a>. I did not need
    to do this.
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
      sudo ln -s /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab
    </script>

  <p>
    devkitPro provides libraries for many systems, however, we are only interested in the one used for GBA development.
    To install this we will run the following (Install All):
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
        sudo dkp-pacman -S gba-dev
    </script>

  <p>
    Now we will need to define some environment variables so that we can reference devkitPro by name in our makefile. To
    do so run the following commands:
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
      export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
      export DEVKITARM=/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM
      export DEVKITPPC=/opt/devkitpro/devkitPPC
    </script>

  <p>
    Now open VSCode in Windows. In the bottom left corner, select the green button. Then select "Connect to WSL" and
    <i>File > Open</i> the instillation folder.
  </p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="/projects/Gameboy/files/wsl-statusbar-indicator.png" id="figure" style="width: 30%;" />
  </div>

  <p>
    Now open a terminal in VSCode and ensure you can build the project.
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
      make clean
      make
    </script>

  <p>
    If you want to make your own project, simply create a new folder on the desktop and copy the <span
      style="color: white; background-color: black;">Makefile</span> I have created. You will also need to create a
    <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">source</span> and <span
      style="color: white; background-color: black;">include</span> folder. The source folder must contain a <span
      style="color: white; background-color: black;">main.c</span> file with a <span
      style="color: white; background-color: black;">int main(){}</span> function.
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup">
      └── Desktop/
          └── Your Folder Name/
              ├── source/
              │   └── main.c

<button class="collapsible">Memory Registers &#9205;</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">

  <p>
    On the GBA, specific areas of memory are mapped directly to hardware functions. To get the GBA to do anything, you
    need to write specific bits to specific sections of memory. This is known as <b>memory-mapped IO</b>. This means if
    we want to create some sprites we need to understand the register layout of the system memory. Luckily the hardware
    is well documented in the <a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">Tonc Text</a> and the <a
      href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~tjh8300/CowBite/CowBiteSpec.htm">CowBite Spec</a>. <b>Disclaimer:</b> Hardware
    documentation for this blog post are mostly summarized from theses sources. You really should read those for a full
    understanding. However, I know you're here because you don't want to do that. So, I will summarize the content you
    need to know for rest of this blog post. This is where the fun begins...

<button class="collapsible">Sprite Structure &#9205;</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">

  <p>
    Our goal now is to get a sprite displayed on the screen. This may sound simple... however... there is a lot you need to know first. I will begin by explaining how sprites are structured into <b>Tiles and Palettes</b>. Then I will explain the memory registers (<b>VRAM, PAL RAM, and OAM</b>) where sprite data/attributes are stored. Then I will explain the display register <b>REG_DISPCNT</b> which is the primary control of the screen. This is going to be a long "spit facts at you" section, but its pretty vital to your understanding of the code. After this, I promise we can start programming. If you don't care how anything works you can skip this section.
  </p>

  <h2>Tiles and Palettes</h2>

  <p>
    The GBA CAN represent graphics in a bitmap mode (meaning to plot a pixel at location (x,y), go to location y*w+x and
    fill in the color). You COULD make games based purely on the bitmap modes, but very few do (DOOM does). Unless
    you're willing to optimize the crap out of your code, you'll have a hard time doing it. The vast majority of games
    use the GBA's hardware graphics, which come in the forms of tiles and palettes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sprites are smaller objects between 8x8 to 64x64 pixels in size. The GBA allows for <b>128 sprites</b> and you can
    move them independently of each other. Sprites are composed of a matrix of smaller bitmaps called <b>tiles</b>. Your
    basic tile is an 8x8 pixel bitmap. Tiles come in two types: <b>4BPP</b> (bits per pixel) and <b>8BPP</b>. The
    sprites I made don't require more than 16 colors so I will use 4BPP mode.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>8BPP</b> - 256 Colors (2<sup>8</sup>), 64 bytes per tile, 8 bits per pixel. Each pixel in a tile is an 8-bit
    index value of a 256 color palette.
    <br>
    <b>4BPP</b> - 16 Colors (2<sup>4</sup>), 32 bytes per tile, 4 bits per pixel. Attribute 2 of the <b>OAM</b> data
    contains a 4 bit index into 16 distinct palettes which contain 16 colors values.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know that was a lot of information so lets look at some pretty pictures now. Consider the picture below of a
    sprite that I made of my friend Will. This is a 32x32 pixel image (I scaled up by factor of 4 so that I can
    demonstrate tiles and palettes). The first thing we do is break the image into a <b>tilemap</b>. The tilemap should
    consist of 16 <b>tiles</b> each containing 8x8 pixels. Also note that the sprite consists of just 8 unique colors
    (because Will is just a simple little guy). This set of colors is known as the <b>palette</b>. The first color in
    the palette is considered to be transparent (meaning it wont be rendered).
  </p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="/projects/Gameboy/files/Will0.png" id="figure" style="width: 10%;" />
    <img src="/projects/Gameboy/files/Will1.png" id="figure" style="width: 10%;" />
  </div>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="/projects/Gameboy/files/WillPal.png" id="figure" style="width: 20%;" />
  </div>

  <p>
    The tilemap is 16x8x8 = 1024 pixels total. Each pixel contains a 4 bit index of the color palette. This means the
    sprite is 1024 * (4/8) = 512 Bytes. The color palette has 8 colors. <b>Each color is a 16 bit value</b> (using 5
    bits for red, green, and blue, and ignoring last bit). Meaning the palette takes up 8x(16/8) = 16 Bytes. So, total
    storage of the sprite is 512+16 = <b>528 Bytes</b>. We can reduce this by noticing some of the tiles are identical
    (completely black) so there is no need to store them twice. Im not going to do this just to keep things simple but
    its an option if you're feeling spicy.

  <pre>
      F E D C  B A 9 8  7 6 5 4  3 2 1 0
      <font color="black">X</font> <font color="blue">B B B  B B</font> <font color="green">G G  G G G</font> <font color="red">R  R R R R</font>
  
      0-4 <font color="red">(R)</font> = Red
      5-9 <font color="green">(G)</font> = Green
      A-F <font color="blue">(B)</font> = Blue
    </pre>

  </p>

  <h2>VRAM, PAL RAM, and OAM</h2>

  <p>
    None of this really matters until you put the 512B of tile data and 16B of palette data into memory. Now we get to
    touch some code! Lets start with the tiles first. We need to put the tiles in <b>VRAM</b> which starts at 0x06000000
    and is 96KB long. Tonclib breaks the VRAM into <b>charblocks</b>. Each charblock is 16KB, so there is 6 charblocks
    in VRAM. The first 4 are for background tiles and the last two are for sprite tiles. This means two things: we can
    have (16KB*2)/32B = <b>1024 Sprite Tiles</b>, and sprite tiles are stored 16KB*4 = 64KB (0x10000) into VRAM. In
    other words: <b>sprite tiles start at 0x06010000</b>. So to get the sprite tiles into memory we need to copy all
    512B to 0x06010000 which is known as <b>tile_mem_obj</b> in tonclib.
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
    // snippet from tonc_types.h
    typedef struct { u32 data[8];  } TILE, TILE4;
    typedef TILE  CHARBLOCK[512];

    // snippet from tonc_memmap.h
    #define MEM_VRAM	    0x06000000	//!< Video RAM. Note: no 8bit write !!
    #define VRAM_BG_SIZE	0x10000		//!< BG VRAM size
    #define MEM_VRAM_OBJ	(MEM_VRAM + VRAM_BG_SIZE) //!< Object VRAM address
    #define tile_mem_obj	((CHARBLOCK*)MEM_VRAM_OBJ)
  </script>

  <p>
    Palettes are stored in <b>PAL RAM</b> which starts at 0x05000000 and is 1KB long. PAL RAM is split into two even
    sections. The first for backgrounds and the second for sprites. So we have 512B for sprite palettes which starts at
    0x05000000+512B = 0x05000200. Since each color is 16 bits (2B) that means we have room for 512B/(2B/Color) = 256
    Colors. In 4BPP Mode this means we have 16 palettes each with 16 colors (16*16 = 256). So to get the sprite palette
    into memory we need to copy all 16B to 0x05000200 which is known as <b>pal_obj_mem</b> in tonclib.
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
    // snippet from tonc_types.h
    typedef u16 COLOR;  //!< Type for colors

    // snippet from tonc_memmap.h
    #define PAL_BG_SIZE   0x00200		//!< BG palette size
    #define MEM_PAL_OBJ		(MEM_PAL + PAL_BG_SIZE)		//!< Object palette address
    #define pal_obj_mem		((COLOR*)MEM_PAL_OBJ)
  </script>

  <p>
    The Object Attribute Memory (<b>OAM</b>) which starts at 0x07000000, tells the GBA how you want to draw each sprite (object). This register is a little complex so read the Tonc Text for more info. The basics you need to know is each sprite (or object) has 3 attributes. I'll provide some details for those below but you don't need to understand them fully for this blog post.

    By setting the bits for <b>DCNT_OBJ</b>, we can enable objects (sprites) to be seen. We need to also tell the GBA how the sprite tiles are stored. We can do this by setting the bits for <b>DCNT_OBJ_1D</b>. In 1D mode, tiles are stored sequentially. So the sprite I showed earlier would actually be stored in memory like this:
  </p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="/projects/Gameboy/files/WillTiles.png" id="figure" style="width: 40%;" />
  </div>

  <p>
    In code, setting these bits is really easy thanks to the tonclib library. We simply need to do the following:
  </p>

  <script type="text/plain" class="language-c">
    REG_DISPCNT = DCNT_OBJ | DCNT_OBJ_1D;
  </script>

    To create our sprite, we first need to draw it. I prefer to use photoshop for this but there are many tools available and you cant really go wrong. Just remember your sprite must be a set size. I will list the possible sizes below. For simplicity I will use the same 32x32 pixel sprite of our good pal Will from the previous section.

    Now that we have our sprite image, we need to use a tool called <a href="https://www.gbadev.org/tools.php?showinfo=1441">Usenti</a> to convert it to C code. I will provide the original Will sprite image below for your use.
  </p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="/projects/Gameboy/files/Will.bmp" id="figure" style="width: 5%;" />
  </div>

  <p>
    Simply download this file, and open it in Usenti. You should see a window that looks like this:
  </p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="/projects/Gameboy/files/Usenti1.png" id="figure" style="width: 20%;" />
  </div>

  <p>
    You will first want to make sure you have the correct number of colors by selecting <code>Palette > Requantize</code>. Since you can only have 16 colors, you'll want to type 16 here and then click <code>OK</code>. Next you want to reorder you palette by selecting <code>Palette > Sort</code>. I like to sort my palette by ascending brightness beginning from color 0 and ending at color 15. This is because the first color is your transparent color and I usually use black for that. Now that that is done, you can save you sprite by selecting <code>File > Save As</code>. I will save my file as <code>Will.bmp</code>. When prompted, you want to select a bit depth of 4 (assuming you are using 4BPP Mode). Now the scary part. You want to export your image as GBA Source Code by selecting <code>Image > Export</code> and selecting a destination. You will see the following window appear:
  </p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="/projects/Gameboy/files/Usenti2.png" id="figure" style="width: 30%;" />
  </div>

  <p>
    Don't panic this is actually really simple. We want to select basically all the options in the screenshot. First select <code>Gfx</code> and select <code>tile</code>. You want <code>4bpp</code> mode. You can choose to use compression if you have a lot of duplicate tiles but im not going to. Next, under <code>Meta/Obj</code> select the aspect ratio of your sprite. Mine is <code>Square</code>. My Sprite is also 4x4 tiles (32x32 pixels) so I will select that option as well. FOr the <code>Pal</code> section simply select the number of colors you need to use. For me it's 8. Now you want to make sure <code>h file</code> is selected under the <code>File</code> section. You can choose to group the bytes as <code>u8, u16, or u32</code>. Functionally this is makes no deference since it will be the same number of bytes regardless. This is more a question of readability. I personally like u16 because it makes the colors easier to read. Once you are done click <code>OK</code> and Usenti will export two files:
    <a href="/projects/Gameboy/files/Will.c">Will.c</a> and <a href="/projects/Gameboy/files/Will.h">Will.h</a>. These can be copies to the <code>source</code> and <code>include</code> folders of your workspace respectively. Now we can actually write some code :)!
