<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<!-- <p>
    Welcome! To explore my current interests, please consult the table below.
    This table acts as a directory for a set of blog posts relating to my
    various side projects. I try to make a blog post for every "major step"
    in a project (there is even a post for the creation of this table).
    The more complex topics will have multiple entries labeled under respective titles.
